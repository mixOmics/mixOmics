# mixOmics
This repository includes three branches, our master branch (current version on R CRAN), devel branch (what we are up to) and 
BioC for our recent BioC submission.


mixOmics is collaborative project developed by the mixOmics team (Kim-Anh Lê Cao - https://lecao-lab.science.unimelb.edu.au, Florian Rohart - http://florian.rohart.free.fr, Ignacio González and Sébastien Déjean - https://perso.math.univ-toulouse.fr/dejean/), key contributors (Benoît Gautier, François Bartolo) and several key collaborators. The project started at the Institut de Mathématiques de Toulouse, Université Paul Sabatier, Toulouse, France and was then further extended in Australia, at the University of Queensland, Brisbane (2009 – 2016) and at the University of Melbourne, Australia (2017 – ).


mixOmics offers a wide range of multivariate methods for the exploration and integration of biological datasets with a particular focus on variable selection.

Single ‘omics analysis does not provide enough information to give a deep understanding of a biological system, but we can obtain a more holistic view of a system by combining multiple ‘omics analyses. Our mixOmics R package proposes a whole range of multivariate methods that we developed and validated on many biological studies to gain more insight into ‘omics biological studies.
