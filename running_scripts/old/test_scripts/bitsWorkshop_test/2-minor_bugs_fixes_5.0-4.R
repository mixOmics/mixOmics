# in the network function, I have only changed the default color to color.GreenRed (instead of blue, red as
# previously set)

# 2 - small fix: splsda.Rd: email from Carlos
# 
# Carlos email
# . I was using the example with the breast.tumors dataset available at http://127.0.0.1:30821/library/mixOmics/html/plsda.html
# 
# and I think there's an error in the legend plotting, since the points that belong to the before treatment appear as after treatment and viceversa.
# 
# I guess it's because when the color palette is specified with
# palette(c("red", "blue"))
# 
# the "After" points are assigned red and the "Before" points are colored with blue. And in the legend the color blue shows first so it is labeled as "After".
# 
# For example the point 23 is colored blue and labeled as After treatment in the legend, but in the raw data it's assigned as before treatment.

# =============================================================
## First example
data(breast.tumors)
X <- breast.tumors$gene.exp
# Y will be transformed as a factor in the function,
# but we set it as a factor to set up the colors.
Y <- as.factor(breast.tumors$sample$treatment)

res <- splsda(X, Y, ncomp = 2, keepX = c(25, 25))

col.breast <- color.mixo(as.numeric(Y))

# individual names appear
plotIndiv(res, ind.names = Y, col = col.breast)
legend('topright', c('Before', 'After'), pch = c(16, 16), 
       col = unique(col.breast), 
       title = "Treatment")

# check:color match
data.frame(col.breast, Y)


## Second example
data(liver.toxicity)
X <- as.matrix(liver.toxicity$gene)
# Y will be transformed as a factor in the function,
# but we set it as a factor to set up the colors.
Y <- as.factor(liver.toxicity$treatment[, 4])

splsda.liver <- splsda(X, Y, ncomp = 2, keepX = c(20, 20))

col.rat <- color.mixo(Y)
# individual name is set to the treatment
plotIndiv(splsda.liver, col = col.rat, ind.names = Y)



# ============================================================
# 3 - small fix: sgcca, email from Bernard Wone, 15/02/2015
# I think there is a bug in the plotVar function because it is plotting variables not selected for block 2. The code I used to plot selected variables in block 2 is 
# 
# plotVar(wrap.result.sgcca, comp = c(1,2), block = 2, ncomp.select = 1, labels = TRUE, cex=0.5, col = 'blue').
# 
# If I look at the loadings for that block and comp, some of those variables plotted have zero loading values.
